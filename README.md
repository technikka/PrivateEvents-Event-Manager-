# Private Events

(Really should have called this Event Manager, as the events do not have functionality to be private.) 

This was a project assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) to practice more advanced Active Record associations. It is a site which allows users to create events and register to attend other users events, thereby representing a many-to-many relationship, implementing has_many :through associations.

## Roadmap

I'd like to come back to this project and develop it more fully. A lot of opportunities to learn new features here. Next up: 

* Allow events to be private and let the user manage attendence.
* Allow events to be searchable by the user and with filers for location, etc.
* CSS

## Reflections

It ended up taking a few full days experimenting with how to declare the associations in the model and with what options, and to create a corresponding migration specified in a way that works with the model. I read about associations (with migrations) from many resources and tried many many things before finding the solution I needed. Though weeks like this are a bit frustrating, they are also a blessing. I now feel like I have a nearly adept understanding of associations, feel more comfortable with migrations, and learned some random neat tricks along the way.
